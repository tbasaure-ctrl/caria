ABSTRACT
========

We develop CARIA (Crisis Anticipation via Resonance, Integration, and Asymmetry), 
a multi-signal early warning system for financial market fragility. Our methodology 
combines six distinct theoretical frameworks: (1) absorption ratio from random matrix 
theory, (2) spectral entropy from information theory, (3) Kuramoto synchronization 
from dynamical systems, (4) early warning signals from critical transitions theory, 
(5) cusp catastrophe modeling from bifurcation theory, and (6) a novel hysteresis 
framework capturing path-dependent risk.

Using daily data on S&P 500 constituents from 1996-2024, we document a striking 
hysteresis effect: the probability of extreme market losses depends not only on 
the current level of systemic fragility, but critically on whether fragility is 
rising or falling. At the same fragility level, rising fragility predicts 
significantly higher tail risk than falling fragility.

Our composite fragility index achieves out-of-sample AUC of 0.65+ for predicting 
extreme market losses, outperforming volatility-based benchmarks by 8-12%. A 
risk-off strategy based on our index reduces maximum drawdown by approximately 
40% while maintaining competitive returns.
