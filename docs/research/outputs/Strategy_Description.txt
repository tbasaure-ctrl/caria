DYNAMIC ALLOCATION BASED ON ACCUMULATED SPECTRAL FRAGILITY
===========================================================

Investment Rule:
----------------
The strategy dynamically adjusts equity exposure based on a structural 
fragility signal derived from the correlation matrix of a diversified 
asset universe.

1. ASF CALCULATION:
   - Compute rolling 126-day correlation matrix with Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage
   - Calculate normalized spectral entropy of eigenvalue distribution
   - Apply exponential decay weighting (half-life = 139 days)
   
2. SIGNAL GENERATION:
   - Compute 5-year rolling 80th percentile of ASF
   - When ASF exceeds its 80th percentile: ELEVATED FRAGILITY
   - When ASF is below 80th percentile: NORMAL CONDITIONS

3. POSITION SIZING:
   - Elevated Fragility: Reduce equity exposure to 50%
   - Normal Conditions: Full equity exposure (100%)
   - Rebalance weekly to reduce turnover

Implementation Notes:
---------------------
- No lookahead bias: all signals use only past data
- Volatility-standardized returns (shifted by 1 day)
- Rolling quantile avoids full-sample parameter fitting

Performance Summary (1995-2025):
--------------------------------
                    Benchmark       ASF Strategy
CAGR:               6.25%           7.23%          (+0.98% excess)
Volatility:         19.26%          15.61%         (-3.65% reduction)  
Sharpe Ratio:       0.41            0.53           (+0.12 improvement)
Max Drawdown:       -56.78%         -49.15%        (+7.63% reduction)
CVaR (5%):          -2.92%          -2.38%         (+0.54% improvement)

Economic Interpretation:
------------------------
The strategy capitalizes on the observation that structural fragility 
(correlation compression) accumulates silently during periods of low 
volatility, creating conditions for severe drawdowns. By reducing 
exposure when fragility is elevated, the strategy avoids the worst 
outcomes while participating in normal market appreciation.
