======================================================================
ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATION FOR theta = 0.995
======================================================================

Persistence parameter: theta = 0.995
Half-life: 138 trading days (approx 6.6 months)


Economic Rationale:
--------------------------------------------------

1. INSTITUTIONAL REPORTING CYCLES
   - Quarterly reports (13F filings): 3 months
   - Semi-annual rebalancing: 6 months
   - Annual performance reviews: 12 months
   -> 6-month half-life captures semi-annual adjustment cycle

2. BALANCE SHEET ADJUSTMENT SPEED
   - He & Krishnamurthy (2013) document that intermediary 
     balance-sheet constraints adjust over months, not days
   - Adrian & Shin (2010) show leverage targeting with 
     similar adjustment horizons
   -> theta = 0.995 consistent with intermediary dynamics

3. POSITION BUILDUP DYNAMICS
   - Crowded trades develop over quarters as momentum 
     investors accumulate positions
   - Leverage constraints bind gradually as VaR limits 
     are approached
   -> Slow memory appropriate for "stored fragility"

4. EMPIRICAL ROBUSTNESS
   - From sensitivity analysis (Appendix Figure A.6):
     Sign inversion robust for theta in [0.90, 0.999]
   - Optimal theta depends on forecast horizon
   -> theta = 0.995 is central tendency, not knife-edge

PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: COORDINATION REGIME
======================================================================

REVIEWER CONCERN:
"Does high ASF mean investors should avoid diversifying?"

CLARIFICATION:
The finding is NOT that diversification is bad, but that:

1. DIVERSIFICATION BENEFITS ARE REGIME-DEPENDENT
   - In low-connectivity regimes: Traditional diversification works
   - In high-connectivity regimes: Correlations are already high,
     so "diversification" provides less marginal benefit

2. THE RISK IS COORDINATION BREAKDOWN, NOT DIVERSIFICATION
   - High ASF indicates synchronized markets
   - The danger is when synchronization breaks down
   - Diversification doesn't protect against this specific risk

3. PRACTICAL IMPLICATION
   NOT: "Avoid diversifying when ASF is high"
   BUT: "Recognize that standard diversification metrics may 
        overstate protection when ASF is high"

4. MONITORING RECOMMENDATION
   - Track ASF alongside VaR/volatility
   - When ASF is elevated, consider:
     a) Stress-testing for correlation breakdown
     b) Reducing leverage (not diversification)
     c) Maintaining liquidity buffers

5. WHAT INVESTORS SHOULD DO
   - Continue diversifying (it's never harmful)
   - But adjust risk models to account for regime
   - Consider structural indicators in addition to volatility

QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES (require data)
======================================================================

To run the quantitative analyses, load your price data and call:

1. Rolling Threshold:
   results = rolling_threshold_analysis(returns_df, estimation_window_years=5)

2. Data Splicing:
   comparison = data_splicing_analysis(global_macro_returns, etf_returns)

3. Hysteresis Test:
   hysteresis_significance_test(asf_series, drawdown_series)
